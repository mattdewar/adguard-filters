# Personal AdGuard Annoyance Filters

This repository contains my collection of custom AdGuard annoyance filter lists. These filter lists are tailored to block intrusive elements like pop-ups, banners, and widgets and other such junk.

## Installation

1. Open AdGuard.

2. Navigate to **Filters** > **Add Custom Filter**.

3. Add the URL of the raw filter list, for example:

```txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattdewar/adguard-filters/refs/heads/main/annoyances.txt
```

4. Enjoy less annoying junk.
